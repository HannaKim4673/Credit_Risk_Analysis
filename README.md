# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

### Purpose
The main purpose of this analysis was to determine which of 6 machine learning models that utilize resampling would be best suited for identifying whether or not a loan is good or risky based on a variety of factors like loan type. In short, 6 models were used to make predictions for the same loan dataset to see which model would best predict credit card risk. The 6 models that were used include RandomOverSampler algorithm, SMOTE algorithm, ClusterCentroids algorithm, SMOTEENN algorithm, BalancedRandomForestClassifier model, and EasyEnsembleClassifier model. 

## Results

### RandomOverSampler Algorithm Model
![](https://github.com/HannaKim4673/Credit_Risk_Analysis/blob/main/figure%201.png)
 - As visible in output cell 14 of the above image, the balanced accuracy score for this model is about 0.64. This indicates that this model is fairly good at correctly identifying risky and good loans, since the score is closer to 1 than 0.
 - As for the precision score, it is 0.99 as seen in the output for cell 16 in the above image. While a score of 0.99 may make this model look good at reliably determining high risk loans, that actually is not the case. Looking at the precision scores for each loan type - i.e., high risk and low risk - in the above image, these scores reveal that this model more reliably predicts low risk loans than high risk loans, since the precision score for the high risk loans is 0.01 while the precision score for low risk loans is an incredibly high 1.00.
 - Finally, the recall score for this model is 0.67, as seen in output for cell 16 in the above image. This result reveals that this model is more sensitive than precise, and as a result, there is less of a chance that a loan predicted to be low risk by this model will actually be high risk - i.e., there is less chance of false negatives occurring. 

### SMOTE Algorithm Model

 - As visible in output cell 19 of the above image, the balanced accuracy score for this model is about 0.65. This indicates that this model is fairly good at correctly identifying risky and good loans, since the score is cabove 0.50.
 - As for the precision score, it is 0.99 as seen in the output for cell 21 in the above image. While a score of 0.99 may make this model look good at reliably determining high risk loans, that actually is not the case. Looking at the precision scores for each loan type - i.e., high risk and low risk - in the above image, these scores reveal that this model more reliably predicts low risk loans than high risk loans, since the precision score for the high risk loans is 0.01 while the precision score for low risk loans is an incredibly high 1.00.
 - Finally, the recall score for this model is 0.66, as seen in output for cell 21 in the above image. This result reveals that this model is more sensitive than precise, and as a result, there is less of a chance that a loan predicted to be low risk by this model will actually be high risk - i.e., there is less chance of false negatives occurring. 

### ClusterCentroids Algorithm Model
![](https://github.com/HannaKim4673/Credit_Risk_Analysis/blob/main/figure%203.png)
 - As visible in output cell 24 in the above image, the balanced accuracy score for this model is about 0.51. Given that the score is not particularly close to either 0 or 1 and is not very far from 0.50, it would appear that this model is not particularly good at accurately identifying high risk and low risk loans.
 - As for the precision score, it is 0.99 as seen in the output for cell 26 in the above image. While a score of 0.99 may make this model look good at reliably determining high risk loans, that actually is not the case. Looking at the precision scores for each loan type - i.e., high risk and low risk - in the above image, these scores reveal that this model more reliably predicts low risk loans than high risk loans, since the precision score for the high risk loans is 0.01 while the precision score for low risk loans is an incredibly high 1.00.
 - On the other hand, the recall score for this model is 0.44, as seen in the output for cell 26 in the above image. This reveals that this model is not as sensitive as the preceding two models, and as a result, it is more likely that a loan predicted to be low risk by this model will actually be high risk.

### SMOTEENN Algorithm Model
![](https://github.com/HannaKim4673/Credit_Risk_Analysis/blob/main/figure%204.png)
 - As visible in output cell 29 of the above image, the balanced accuracy score for this model is about 0.64. This indicates that this model is fairly good at correctly identifying risky and good loans, since the score is closer to 1 than 0.
 - As for the precision score, it is 0.99 as seen in the output for cell 31 in the above image. While a score of 0.99 may make this model look good at reliably determining high risk loans, that actually is not the case. Looking at the precision scores for each loan type - i.e., high risk and low risk - in the above image, these scores reveal that this model more reliably predicts low risk loans than high risk loans, since the precision score for the high risk loans is 0.01 while the precision score for low risk loans is an incredibly high 1.00.
 - Finally, the recall score for this model is 0.58, as seen in output for cell 31 in the above image. This result reveals that this model is more sensitive than precise, and as a result, there is less of a chance that a loan predicted to be low risk by this model will actually be high risk - i.e., there is less chance of false negatives occurring.

### BalancedRandomForestClassifier Model
![](https://github.com/HannaKim4673/Credit_Risk_Analysis/blob/main/figure%205.png)
 - As visible in output cell 40 of the above image, the balanced accuracy score for this model is about 0.79. This indicates that this model is quite good at correctly identifying risky and good loans, since the score is closer to 1 than 0.
 - As for the precision score, it is 0.99 as seen in the output for cell 42 in the above image. While a score of 0.99 may make this model look good at reliably determining high risk loans, that actually is not the case. Looking at the precision scores for each loan type - i.e., high risk and low risk - in the above image, these scores reveal that this model more reliably predicts low risk loans than high risk loans, since the precision score for the high risk loans is 0.04 while the precision score for low risk loans is an incredibly high 1.00.
 - Finally, the recall score for this model is 0.91, as seen in output for cell 42 in the above image. This result reveals that this model is much more sensitive than precise, and as a result, there is very little chance that a loan predicted to be low risk by this model will actually be high risk - i.e., there is a very low chance of false negatives occurring.

### EasyEnsembleClassifier Model
![](https://github.com/HannaKim4673/Credit_Risk_Analysis/blob/main/figure%206.png)
 - As visible in output cell 45 of the above image, the balanced accuracy score for this model is about 0.79. This indicates that this model is quite good at correctly identifying risky and good loans, since the score is closer to 1 than 0.
 - As for the precision score, it is 0.99 as seen in the output for cell 47 in the above image. While a score of 0.99 may make this model look good at reliably determining high risk loans, that actually is not the case. Looking at the precision scores for each loan type - i.e., high risk and low risk - in the above image, these scores reveal that this model more reliably predicts low risk loans than high risk loans, since the precision score for the high risk loans is 0.07 while the precision score for low risk loans is an incredibly high 1.00.
 - Finally, the recall score for this model is 0.94, as seen in output for cell 47 in the above image. This result reveals that this model is much more sensitive than precise, and as a result, there is very little chance that a loan predicted to be low risk by this model will actually be high risk - i.e., there is a very low chance of false negatives occurring.

## Summary
Overall, the results of this analysis revealed that all six of the models tested here are more sensitive than precise. This is actually a good thing for detecting credit risk, since it is much better for a loan to be flagged as high risk and investigated - even if it ultimately turns out to be low risk - than for a loan to be identified as low risk and ignored when it is actually high risk. Also, all of the models, except for the ClusterCentroids algorithm model, had fairly high balanced accuracy scores. Furthermore, the least reliable model out of all the models tested turned out to be the ClusterCentroids algorithm model, which used undersampling and had a low recall score of 0.44. On the other hand, all the models that used oversampling - i.e., the RandomOverSampler algorithm model and the SMOTE algorithm - had higher recall scores of 0.67 and 0.66 respectively meaning these models would be much better for detecting credit risk than any model utilizing undersampling. Interestingly, the SMOTEENN model, which utilized both undersampling and oversampling, had a recall score that was between those of the ClusterCentroids algorithm model and the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE models. While the oversampling models had higher recall scores than the models utilizing undersampling, the two models utilizing ensemble classifiers - i.e., the BalancedRandomForestClassifer model and the EasyEnsembleClassifier model - had the highest recall scores of all. In fact, given that the EasyEnsembleClassifier model had a high balanced accuracy score of about 0.79 and a very high recall score of 0.94, this is the model I would recommend be used to detect credit card risk.
